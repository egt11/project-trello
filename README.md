# Trello Clone

## Overview
A simple Trello-like board built with **vanilla JavaScript** for learning and practice.

**Live Demo:** [Visit the site here. Hosted using GitHub Pages](https://egt11.github.io/project-trello/)

## Key Learnings
- Implemented **drag-and-drop** using events like `dragstart`, `dragover`, and `drop`
- Applied **event delegation** for cleaner event handling
- Practiced **data-driven rendering** (UI reflects the state of arrays/objects)
- Used **localStorage for client-side persistence** to save data across page reloads
